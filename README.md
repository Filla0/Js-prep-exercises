- Which way of representing the traffic light did you find better? Why? </br>
  I think traffic-light-2 is the best way to represent the traffic light because even though they have the same outcome its always better to use a little and simple code to get the job done.
- What happens if you change the loop to a do-while loop instead of a while loop? Why? </br>
  I used while loop and the out come is still the same. because The only difference between the while loop and do...while loop is that the do-while loop will execute at least once because in do...while loop the condition is checked after execution of code block.

- We could have also used a for loop to make the traffic light do 2 full rotations. Do you think that would be better? Why or why not? </br>
  If we use for loop it would still give us same solution. but i think its better to use while loop in this case b/c for loop is used for NUMBER OF ITERATIONS that we know and needed to do.
